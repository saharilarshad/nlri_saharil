## Getting Started

# How to run Server
1. Navigate to backend folder
2. Open terminal and run "npm install"
3. Then run "npm run start:dev"


# How to run Client
1. Navigate to client folder
2. Open terminal and run "npm install"
3. Then run "npm run dev"


# My Thought
1. If deal with real time data, maybe should implement websocket
2. On security, we can implement the authorization with specify request coming from
3. On compability, maybe the old browser not support websocket
